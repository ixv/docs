  *Urbit* is a secure peer-to-peer network of personal servers, built on a clean-slate system software stack.

  Check out the [technical overview](about/overview) for a high-level architecture description.  To install and run Urbit, head to the Using section, starting with the [installation guide](using/install) and continuing forward.

  To begin developing for Urbit, start by walking through [Urbytes](byte/0). After that, delve into Hoon [syntax](hoon/syntax) directly, then walk through the [Arvo tutorials](arvo). The examples and exercises in Arvo will teach you to build high-level programs and interact with the network.

  Dig into the mechanics of Urbit with [Core Hoon](hoon). Refer back there for pure-code exercises and functions in the [standard library](hoon/library).

  Anyone obsessed with math, theory, fundamentals of computation, etc, should start with the [Nock definition](nock/definition) and work upward from there.
